1. path : SELF-DRIVING
	(1) RC Car End-to-End Image Regression with CNNs (RGB camera).ipynb
          : You can make model for self-driving with images and csv file.
	    : But you need to correct some codes for fitting your environment.
	(2) end to end learning for self driving cars.pdf
	    : (1) reference
	(3) CARLA: An Open Urban Driving Simulator.pdf
	    : CARLA reference
	(4) carla ppt.pdf
	    : CARLA reference


2. path : SELF-DRIVING  -  for_data
	(1) vehicle_location_check.py
	    : If you use 'data_collect.py', you need to change starting point of the car.
	    : By using this code, you can find the location of car you want.
	(2) data_collect.py
	    : As the file name, you can collect data(images, csv file) for learning.
	    : But you know, you should change the 'image_save_path' and starting point of car when you want to get new data.
	    : For changing starting point of the car, you correct 'start_point.location' which you find by 'vehicle_location_check.py'.
	    : But you don't need to modify 'start_point.location.z'.


3. path : SELF-DRIVING  -  for_driving
	(1) agent_model
	    : When you want to check the model made by 1-(1), use it.
	(2) new
	    : I got it codes from MinHong, but I haven't used it yet.
	    : After I work it, I will upload this manual for you.


4. path : SELF-DRIVING  -  for_driving  -  agent_model
	(1) *.py
	    : Just run the 'run_my_benchmark.py' for self-driving with model.
	(2) *.h5
	    : examples of model
	    : 'model_background_X_1' and 'Autopilot_aws_carla.h5' are made by CARLA data.
	    : 'Autopilot_aws_rc.h5' is made by RC data.
	(3) etc




5. path : LABEL
	(1) *.ipynb
	    : You can make model for lane detection with original images and labeled images.
